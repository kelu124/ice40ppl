* @Red_Blackice : @black_RustyNai 드디어 맞는 사람을 만났구만. (눈이 조금 빛나기 시작하며) 한 잔 달리러 갈래? 최근 대화한 사람들은 다 술을 잘 안 마셔서 말야.
* @Red_Blackice : @red_Altair 그러게 말야~ (하품을 쭉 하고) 친목회라니까 어울려는 줘야지. 보스의 말을 어찌 거역하겠어.
* @Red_Blackice : @red_Opera 난 단 건 질색이라 말이지. 뭐, 나쁘진 않겠어. 대신 술도 좀 먹어야 해. 알지?
* @black_RustyNai : @Red_Blackice 술? 마시긴 하지. 커피보단 잘 안마시지만. (두눈을 느리게 꿈뻑)
* @Red_Blackice : @red_Lantana 뭐가 좋으려나~ 란타나가 한 말처럼 머리색이랑 연관지으려고 했는데 그럼 저쪽 조직명이잖아? 다른 걸로. (곰곰) 아, 그 귀걸이 예쁘네.
* @red_Altair : @Red_Blackice 하긴... 그쪽 보스가 직접 행차했는데. 부하들이 안올리가 없죠. ( 고민하는 표정 ) 수고하셨습니다. 상대하기도 힘드셨겠네요.
* @Red_Blackice : @red_Vlad_SS 그러려나, 흐으음. 그래도 몇 명쯤은 싸워서 뒤질 정도로 다쳐왔으면 재밌겠는데말야. (이상한 생각...)
* @Red_Blackice : @red_Altair 정신 없었긴 하지. 블랙 녀석들이랑 다같이 만나서, 이것 저것 정신적으로 힘들었어.
* @Red_Blackice : @black_RustyNai 그래? 그럼 뭐. (따라서 어깨 으쓱) 마시는 건 커피만 마시는 거야? 술같은건?
* @Red_Blackice : @red_Dr_teddy_ 어울리는 건 둘째치고, 난 싫으니까... 그럼 대충 오징어랑, 네가 좋아하는 설탕에 찌든 것들 몇개 사가지고 오자. 너도 갈거지? (겉옷을 주섬주섬 입으며)
* @Red_Blackice : @Mafia_wtf 들리지? 들리겠지?
* @BlackIceBDL : #BlackIce Feat Nor-B - "Better Cool It" #MusicVideo #PressPlay https://t.co/o3pD9vQi9i
* @red_Opera : @Red_Blackice 단게 낫지 않...나? 아니다, 사람마다 다르니까 뭐어-.. 술 말고 안주 파괴에는 자신 있는데요. 가도 되는겁니까?
* @red_Lantana : @Red_Blackice 당신이 귀찮아 하지만 않는다면 저야 좋죠.(고개를 끄덕이며 환하게 웃는다)
* @red_Vlad_SS : @Red_Blackice 농담이라니 다행이네요.(미소짓고는)음....지금은 저쪽에서 환자가 많이 나와도 문제 아닐까요. 이왕 나오려면 이 친목회가 끝나고 나서가 좋겠죠. 지금 나오면 나중에 골치아파질걸요?
* @red_Altair : @Red_Blackice .. 푸흐. 그러게요. 첫날부터 정신없어서 그런지.. ( 옅게 웃었나 )
* @black_RustyNai : @Red_Blackice 가장 좋아하는 종류라. 딱히 생각해본적 없는데.. 늘 다르게 마셔서. (어깨 으쓱)
* @Red_Blackice : @red_Opera 단 거보단 쓴 게 낫지. 그럼, 내가 또 술 입은 까다로워서 아주 고급진 것만 먹는 거 알잖아. (물론 알 리가 없겠지만.) 오늘 먹으러 가면 내가 쏜다!
* @Red_Blackice : @red_Dr_teddy_ 으! (미간을 찌푸리며) 말만 들어도 달아 죽겠다. 맥주엔 짠 거지!
* @Red_Blackice : @red_Altair 벌써 피곤해? 아직 11시라고. 정신 차려, 알테어!
* @Red_Blackice : @Black_Quasimodo 하? (집게 손을 탁 치고) 그쪽, 블랙이지?
* @red_Opera : @Red_Blackice 술은 쓰잖아요. 못먹는건 아니지만 나서서 마실만큼 좋아하진 않으니 말입니다. (으쓱이곤) 오, 비싼 안주. 기대해도 되는겁니까?
* @Red_Blackice : @black_RustyNai 오, 생각보다 취향이 확고하진 않네. 난 단 건 못 마셔서 에스프레소나 가끔 마시는데. 가장 좋아하는 종류는 없어?
* @red_Altair : @Red_Blackice ( 깜짝... ) 아... 블랙.. 피곤하다고 생각중이었습니다만...
* @JoesilHC : #BlackIce_2008 https://t.co/bPqQaOUq6c
* @black_RustyNai : @Red_Blackice 왠만한 커피는 가리지 않아. 다 좋아해. (두눈을 느리게 꿈뻑) 다 매력이 넘치거든.
* @Red_Blackice : @red_Altair 무슨 생각해? (팔꿈치로 툭 치며)
* @Red_Blackice : @red_Dr_teddy_ 비싸고 맛있는 거. 보통은... 소고기나 생선? 넌 뭐 좋아하는데?
* @Red_Blackice : @black_LazyBell 그렇지. 해커는 소리 없이 여럿 죽일 수도 있으니까 말야. 물론 직접적으로 죽이는 건 아닐 테지만. 어쩌다 위험한 일에 휘말릴 지도 모르는데, (말을 이으려다가 이내 입을 다물고… https://t.co/XxmQ2eaCbm

* @Red_Blackice : (폭발로 무너진 잔해들을 쳐다보며 혼잣말로) 불에 탔으면 더 아름다웠을텐데 말이야~..
* @black_LazyBell : @Red_Blackice 그건... 차마 생각 못했네요. 뭐, 앉아서 컴퓨터 자판이나 두드리는 해커가 사람 죽이는거에 알아봤자 얼마나 알겠습니까.
* @Red_Blackice : @red_Lantana (네 말에 잠시 멈춰서 생각하다가) 본인이 괜찮다면... 뭐. 별명 지어줄까?
* @Red_Blackice : @black_LazyBell 찔러서 내는 비명이 더 시끄럽겠다. (농담인 듯 웃으면서) 근접에서 처리해야 한다는 점이 귀찮잖아? 처리하기도 그렇고.
* @Red_Blackice : @red_Dr_teddy_ 아무튼, 테디가 맥주까지라면 가끔은 쉬는 겸 해서 맥주로도 괜찮지 뭐. 마실래?
* @red_Lantana : @Red_Blackice 흠..그런가? 뭐, 나는 어찌되든 상관 안쓰니까. 그래도 친한 사람들끼리는 따로 별명 만들어서 부르는 것도 나쁘지 않지 않을까?
* @Red_Blackice : @red_Opera 하하, 술은 안 먹고? 빼기는. 왜, 오늘 운전해야 돼? 술 마실 땐 안주는 당연히 비싼 거로 해야지. 제일 맛있는 걸로다가!
* @black_LazyBell : @Red_Blackice 됐습니다. 저는 총 별로 안좋아해서요. 차라리 칼이 낫지. 푹 찌르는게 탕 소리보단 덜 시끄럽잖아요. (피식 가볍게 웃으며
* @Red_Blackice : @black_LazyBell 완전 현장은 아니지. 스나이핑이니까. 현장직이 아니라면 싫어할 수도 있지, 뭐. 이번에 들었으니 이 기회에 적응하는 건 어때?
* @red_Opera : @Red_Blackice 술....(미묘한 표정으로) 저는 그냥 안주나 집어먹으렵니다. 옆자리 예약해 주십쇼. 기왕이면 안주는 맛있는거로 부탁드립니다?
* @Red_Blackice : @red_Dr_teddy_ 맥주? 맥주라... (곰곰) 그건... 보통 물 대신 아닌가?
* @Red_Blackice : @red_Vlad_SS 뭐 어때, 넌 치료를 할 수 있는 기회까지 있는 거잖아! 더 재밌겠네. (웃다가) 물론 농담이야. 환자는 저기, 저 조직에서 많이 나와야 더 좋지. 너도 편하고.
* @Red_Blackice : @red_Lantana 아무렇게나 불러주는 건 아니지. 그래도 같은 조직인데, 정 없게 말야. 필요한 건 철저히 해둬야지 않겠어?
* @black_LazyBell : @Red_Blackice 저는 현장직이 아니라서요.(어깨를 으쓱한다) 별로 들을 일은 없답니다. 그쪽은 현장직이신가봐요? 총깨나 잡아보신 듯하네요.
* @Red_Blackice : @black_RustyNai 그래? (흥미롭다는 표정) 무슨 커피를 제일 좋아하는데? 역시 아메리카노?
* @Red_Blackice : @red_Dr_teddy_ 아... 알콜 알러지 있는 거야? 그럼 어쩔 수 없지... (술을 싫어한다고는 절대 생각하지 않음!)
* @red_Vlad_SS : @Red_Blackice 어허, 전 의사입니다만? 제가 싸워서 이길 가능성이 얼마나 된다고요.(얕게 고개를 저으며) 저는 환자가 나올 때까지 기다리는 쪽을 택하죠. 아, 안나오면 좋지만.
* @Red_Blackice : @black_LazyBell 총 소리는 잘만 듣잖아? 머리 터지는 소리나, 폭탄 터지는 소리나 거기서 거기지 뭐.
* @Red_Blackice : @red_Opera 뭐... 나도 내가 직접 하는 건 싫어하니까! 대충 술 몇 병 챙겨서 구경이나 하지 뭐.
* @red_Lantana : @Red_Blackice (옅은 웃음을 머금고 바라보며)외우는 방법이야 어찌되었든 이름만 외워주면 돼. 이름 외우는게 힘들다 싶으면 아무렇게나 불러줘도 되고.
* @black_RustyNai : @Red_Blackice (들킨듯 움찔) .. 맞아. 좋아해. (다시금 커피 홀짝)
* @black_LazyBell : @Red_Blackice 시끄럽잖아요... 귀가 다 먹먹하네. 뭐 터지는 그런 소리는 딱 질색입니다.
* @Red_Blackice : @red_Dr_teddy_ 하? (이해가 안 된다는 듯 잠시 눈을 깜빡거리다가 같이 소근거리며) 왜? 어디 운전해 가야할 곳이라도 있어?
* @Red_Blackice : @black_RustyNai 커피 좋아하나봐?
* @red_Opera : @Red_Blackice 그건 그렇긴 합니다.. 무료함만큼 따분한것도 없으니까요.(으쓱이곤) 휘말리는거는 사양입니다. 안전거리를 확보한다면 동참 해 드리겠습니다.
* @Red_Blackice : @black_LazyBell 재밌는데 뭐 어때! 인생에는 저런 폭발이 몇 번 쯤 있어줘야 하는 거지.
* @Red_Blackice : @red_Dr_teddy_ 그래! 팝콘에는 콜라지, 아니면 보드카나 몇 병 땡길까? (신나서)
* @Red_Blackice : @red_Vlad_SS (잠시 혀를 쯧쯔, 차며) 이거 봐. 사람이 착하게 살다보면 재미를 모른다니까? 그럼 이렇게 된 김에 블라드가 가서 싸워봐! 재밌겠다~

* @h_hicayo : @Maria_BlackIce ......... 뭐하려고 ...    (어쩐지 당신에게만큼은 고분고분히 팔을 내준다 . 저번일도그렇고 차츰 익숙해진 모양이다. )
* @Maria_BlackIce : @h_hicayo "또또.. 후.. 난 둘다 있길 바라는데 말이지."  (조용히 작은 목소리로 이야기를 하곤 팔을 만지려했다.)  "실례좀 할께?"
* @Maria_BlackIce : @han_sul_h "아하하.. 뽑아놓고보니까 생각보다 손님 수가 그리 안많더라구요."
* @Maria_BlackIce : @immure__ "용기라.. 누구나가 용기를 내는건 어려워. 그게 자연스러운 사람은 정말 대단한거지. 그러니까 무리해서 낼필요는 없어. 지금 해볼건 가벼운 인사부터야."
* @Uly_pri : @Maria_BlackIce "한잔의 양이 좀 다른거라네 온더록인가 스트레이트인가 하는 거지."  빙긋 웃으며  "그래 또 오시게나. 영업중이라면 언제든."

* @Maria_BlackIce : @Uly_pri "너무 싸게 술을 주시면 곤란하다구요? 술주정뱅이들이 늘어날지도 모르니까 말이죠."  (카드를 넣은 지갑을 주머니에 집어넣었다.)  "그럼 또 들를께요 마스터."
